# Welcome!!

I will show some of the scripts and tools that I like to use during my job and my freetime.

## Scripts

I don't like to care about case sensitive when I am navigating via terminal, so I disable auto complete sensitive case executing the following command in the terminal.

```

CMD: echo 'set completion-ignore-case On' >> /etc/inputrc

```

## Tools

* Broot - https://github.com/Canop/broot

Better way to navigate thrown your directories via terminal

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Lucas-pugliese-barros/fedora-universal-configurations/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
