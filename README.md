# Welcome!!

I will show some of the scripts and tools that I would like to try and others that I use during my job and my freetime.

## Scripts

I don't like to care about case sensitive when I am navigating via terminal, so I disable auto complete sensitive case executing the following command in the terminal.

```

CMD: echo 'set completion-ignore-case On' >> /etc/inputrc

```

## Tools

    Vimium is a browser extension that provides keyboard-based navigation and control of the web in the spirit of the Vim editor.

## I would like to try!!

* **docui** - https://github.com/skanehira/docui
    Seems to be similar to lazydocker, but according to what I read the purpose of the TUI is a little different
